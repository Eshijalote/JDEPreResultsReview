                    <p>The Journal of Development Economics(JDE) now offers authors the opportunity to have their
                        prospective empirical projects reviewed and approved for publication before the empirical
                        results are
                        known. This pre-results review track for submissions is based on a two-stage peer review
                        process.</p><p>In Stage 1, authors submit a proposal that includes an
                        introduction, methods, and data analysis plan for a prospective study <i>(see the optional Stage 1 submission template to learn more)</i>. High-quality studies
                        are accepted based on pre-results review, which constitutes a commitment by the JDE to
                        publish the upcoming paper, regardless of the results. Authors can then collect and analyze
                        the data and submit a full paper for final review and publication (Stage 2). Stage 2 review
                        makes sure that the final paper is aligned with the research design accepted in Stage
                        1.

                <h3>About the JDE Pre-results Review pilot</h3>
                <p>In March 2018, the Journal of Development Economics (JDE) began piloting Pre-results Review track
                    (also referred to as “registered reports” in other disciplines) in collaboration with the Berkeley
                    Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS). Through this track, the JDE reviewed and
                    accepted detailed proposals for prospective empirical projects before results were available,
                    offering a commitment to publish the resulting papers regardless of their findings.</p>
                <p>
                    The motivation behind this exercise was simple: both science and policy should reward projects that
                    ask important questions and employ sound methodology, irrespective of what the results happen to be.
                    By shifting the bulk of the review process (including an editorial decision to accept a paper) to
                    before any results are known, pre-results review has the potential to advance scholarly rigor and
                    transparency by empowering authors to conduct research and report their results transparently, free
                    from fear that certain results could render their papers “unpublishable.” Compared to other
                    sub-disciplines within economics, development economics has long been an area for methodological
                    innovation and rigor, from the widespread adoption of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) starting
                    over two decades ago, to the promotion of study registration and pre-analysis plans in the past
                    decade. Pre-results review is a natural addition to this arsenal of open science tools.</p>
                <p>
                    Since this was (to our knowledge) the first effort to implement pre-results review in an economics
                    journal, we decided to introduce it as a pilot in the hope of learning about its compatibility with
                    existing scholarly conventions in the discipline and its feasibility at the journal. A little over
                    one year in, we reflect on the experience so far and offer our perspectives on the future of
                    pre-results review at the JDE and in the discipline as a whole. Given the largely positive
                    experiences so far, the JDE has decided to make pre-results review a permanent track for article
                    submission at the journal. </p>

                                            <p> However, in some cases Stage 1 Proposals are based around work that is
                                                well underway. If for example, an author has a sample and baseline data
                                                and/or the analysis is pre-registered, it may be problematic or quite

                                                significantly deviate from his/her proposed analysis. Recommendations
                                                should be in the direction of ensuring that the proposed study meets the
                                                quality standards of the JDE, however may be disregarded if the proposed

                                                decide which changes are essential for the study to be accepted based on
                                                pre-results review, and which ones are discretionary for the

                                    Center received his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California at Berkeley
                                    in 1988. He is an empirical microeconomist with interests in the areas of
                                    population, environment, development, and health. Recent work has examined economic
                                    growth in rural India, exploring such issues as growth in the non-farm economy, the
                                    effects of local democratization, groundwater usage, forest cover, household
                                    structure, inequality, and schooling. He also is exploring the effects of recent
                                    changes in air quality in Delhi. Foster also has a series of projects with
