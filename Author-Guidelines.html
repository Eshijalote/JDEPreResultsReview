                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>The <i>Journal of Development Economics</i> (<i>JDE</i>) now
                    offers authors the opportunity to have their prospective empirical projects
                    reviewed and approved for publication <b><i>before </i></b>the results are
                    known. This <i>pre-results review</i> track for submissions is based on a
                    two-stage peer review process, during which authors receive feedback on both
                    the research design and proposed statistical analysis plan (Stage 1) and the
                    full manuscript (Stage 2). Throughout the publishing process, we will refer to
                    articles in this track as “<a href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Reports”,</a>
                    in line with the terminology adopted by journals in other disciplines and the
                    existing Elsevier publishing infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Stage 1 submissions for pre-results review (referred to in
                    the submissions portal as “Registered Report Stage 1: Proposal”) typically
                    include key background literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses,
                    study procedures, proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power
                    analysis, and pilot data (if applicable). Following peer review, high-quality
                    Stage 1 Proposals are <b><i>accepted based on pre-results review</i></b><i>, </i>after
                    which authors implement the pre-specified research design and submit a full
                    manuscript (referred to in the submissions portal as “Registered Report Stage
                    2: Full Article”), including results and discussion sections. This final
                    manuscript is appraised by reviewers for quality assurance and then published,
                    provided that the implementation of the data collection and analysis maintains
                    high standards of quality (see Appendix A: Flowchart of the Pre-Results Review
                    Process at the JDE). </p>

                <p>The pre-results review track is designed to award
                    well-designed and well-executed studies regardless of whether their empirical
                    results yield clear interpretations. With that in mind, we envision that this
                    track for submissions will be particularly attractive to development economists
                    working on research projects for which the data is yet to be collected (or
                    researchers who have not yet had access to the data they will analyze).
                    Submissions where follow-up data have been collected (outside of pilot and
                    baseline data) are in principle not eligible for this track. Work should be
                    submitted at <b>a minimum of three months, but ideally six months to a year,
                        before data collection of the key outcome data.</b> All participants in the
                    review process including the authors, the referees, and the editors must be
                    blind to the key outcome variables throughout Stage 1.</p>

                <p>Submissions for pre-results review follow the same
                    publishing policies and formatting rules as regular submissions outlined in the
                    <a

                    Editorial Decisions</h4>

                <p>The Editorial Board will make an effort to ensure that
                    manuscripts at Stage 2 are considered by the same reviewers as at Stage 1,
                    however they may also invite new reviewers. To ensure continuity, reviewers at
                    Stage 2 will have access to the original Stage 1 Proposal submission that was
                    accepted based on pre-results review.</p>

                <p>In considering full manuscripts at Stage 2, reviewers will
                    be asked to evaluate:</p>

              <ol><li> <p  >Whether
                    the study was implemented according to the research design pre-specified at
                    Stage 1. This involves an evaluation of whether the study implementation
                    maintained high standard of quality, particularly whether the attrition rate
                    was high in the given context, or there was a high differential attrition
                    between treatment and control groups;</p>
              </li><li>
                <p  >Whether
                    the collected data is of sufficient quality to test the pre-specified
                    hypotheses. In particular, whether the pre-specified data quality checks were
                    satisfied and descriptive statistics provide convincing evidence that the data can
                    credibly measure the impact of the intervention;</p>
              </li><li>
                <p  >In cases
                    of deviations from the pre-specified research design, whether the author(s)
                    provided a convincing theoretical and/or methodological justification;</p>
              </li><li>
                <p  >Whether
                    any exploratory analyses added by the authors are justified, methodologically
                    sound, and informative. Exploratory analyses must be clearly noted, and the
                    results of all hypotheses specified in the Stage 1 submission must be reported.</p>
              </li><li>
                <p  >Whether
                    the author's’ interpretation of the research findings are consistent with the
                    data and the overall evidence.</p>

                <p>Following Stage 2 of peer review, submissions will be either

                    the pre-results track (see next section for possible reasons for rejection at
                    Stage 2).</p>

                <p><b>Editorial decisions will not be based on the perceived
                    importance, novelty or conclusiveness of the results</b>. This is a key feature
                    of pre-results review. Whereas reviewers are free to enter such comments on the
                    record, they will not influence editorial decisions. Reviewers at Stage 2 may
                    suggest that authors report additional tests which were not pre-specified,
                    however, authors are not obliged to do so unless such tests are necessary to
                    satisfy one or more of the Stage 2 review criteria.</p>

                    Pre-specified Research Design</h4>

                <p>It is reasonable to expect that
                    pre-specified research designs may sometimes run into practical difficulties in
                    their implementation. Authors should keep records of all instances when the
                    study could be completed as specified, and clearly report and justify them in
                    their Stage 2 Full Article submission. If authors want to discuss the context
                    and provide justification for deviations in greater detail, they may choose to
                    attach a cover letter to their Stage 2 submission.</p>

                <p>In principle, deviations
                    resulting from a limited uptake of an intervention which was conducted as
                    specified (e.g. if the treatment group persistently failed to comply with the
                    intervention, or the intervention proved impractical) may be justifiable.
                    However, authors should anticipate such challenges as much as possible in their
                    Stage 1 submission and propose measures to prevent them.</p>

                <p>In all instances of deviations,
                    the Editorial Board will determine whether they were clearly reported and
                    justifiable on theoretical and/or methodological grounds. The Editorial Board
                    may decide that the study is no longer eligible for publication in the

                    analyses were pre-specified, thereby ensuring the validity of the research
                    findings. To protect the integrity and confidentiality of studies which are

                <p>Stage 1 Proposal submissions may receive a desk rejection
                    prior to in-depth peer review if submissions are incomplete or are not
                    considered a good fit for the JDE in terms of the topic, methods or
                    contribution to the development economics literature. The following are some
                    other reasons for desk rejection, and tips for how to avoid each:</p>

                <p  >
                    <ul><li><i>Reason for Rejection:</i> Submission are incomplete or the
                    necessary details of the research design are not reported clearly and in
                    sufficient detail. </p>
            </li><li>
                <p ><i>Tip</i>: Authors are encouraged to
                    consult the <a href="pdf/Stage%201%20Submission%20Template.pdf">Stage 1 Submission Template</a> for
                    guidance on suggested information to include. All Stage 1 submissions should
                    include cover page, abstract, proposed timeline and administrative information
                    section in addition to sections on research design and statistical analysis
                    plan. The research design and analysis should include sufficient detail to
                    enable reviewers to evaluate the submission in the light of the Stage 1
                    criteria outlined above.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p  >
                    <i>Reason for Rejection: </i>Lack of correspondence between the
                    pre-specified hypotheses and the statistical tests.<i> </i></p>
            </li><li>
                <p ><i>Tip: </i>To maximize clarity of
                    correspondence between predictions and analyses, authors are encouraged to
                    number their hypotheses in the introduction section and then number the
                    proposed analyses in the methods section to make clear which analysis tests
                    which prediction. Power analysis, where applicable, should be based on the
                    actual test procedures that will be employed to test those hypotheses.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p  >
                    <i>Reason for Rejection: </i>Statistical power analysis is over-optimistic
                    or insufficiently justified.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p ><i>Tip: </i>Stage 1 submissions
                    should be powered to detect effect that is plausible and of theoretical value.
                    Pilot data can help inform this estimate but is unlikely to form an acceptable
                    basis, alone, for choosing the target effect size.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p  >
                    <i>Reason for Rejection: </i>Failure to clearly distinguish work
                    that has already been done from work that is planned. </p>
            </li><li>
                <p ><i>Tip: </i>Where a proposal contains
                    a mixture of (pilot) work that has already been undertaken and a proposal for
                    work not yet undertaken, authors should use the past tense for pilot work but
                    the future tense for the proposed work. At Stage 2, all descriptions should
                    shift to past tense.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p  >
                    <i>Reason for Rejection: </i>Limited or unclear contribution to
                    the literature.</p>
            </li></ul>
                <p ><i>Tip:</i> Authors will commonly use
                    pre-analysis plans as a base to prepare Stage 1 Proposal for pre-results
                    review. However, Stage 1 Proposals go a step further and require that authors
                    outline the importance of the proposed study in terms of its contribution or
                    value added to the development economics literature (see criterion 1 of the
                    Stage 1 review criteria above). Successful Stage 1 Proposal will mirror
                    full-length conventional articles, with the exception of the ‘Results’ and
                    ‘Discussion’ sections.</p>
